# Best laptop for drawing
Our 2022 review to choose the <a href="https://qualified.one/blog/design/best-laptop-for-drawing/">best laptop for drawing</a>.

With the best drawing laptops and tablets, you can draw on the go â€“ thanks to touchscreens and more. The ability to interact with your digital creation without intermediaries, as well as long battery life, allows you to be creative all day long, wherever you are. Sounds like a dream, right? Well, if you're an artist, you are.

With that in mind, we took a look at the wide range of laptops available today, focusing on performance (quality drawing apps require quite a bit of power), portability, battery life, and screen quality. We also take into account the amount of memory offered by devices, diagonal, keyboard quality and connectivity, among other things.

Luckily, we've been testing PCs for years at our newsroom, and we've collected enough reviews to find the right device for you. And we are not going to throw you among them, we have selected machines that are the best laptops and tablets, ideal for drawing and artwork.

Laptops, as a tool for creating and editing content, will be in demand for a long time, because they combine great performance and a full keyboard with mobility, the ability to take the device anywhere and anytime. Neither a tablet nor a desktop can fully replace a laptop, especially for students, one of the most active groups in the population.

I hope that the above indicated instructions for choosing such a device will allow you to make the right choice among thousands of models. Of course, within the framework of this article it is impossible to cover each individual case, but you can understand the general direction. And it, unfortunately, is such that a simple laptop can be taken from $400, not bad from $600, and different from $800. Of course, for the same money you can take at least a couple of tablets, and try to make presentations, drawings, edit audio and video, and play graphically dull games on them. And if this is exactly what you need, instructions for the optimal choice of tablet are already planned for the foreseeable future.

## HP Spectre x360 (2021)

The 2021 360 Spectre honestly tried to bridge the gap between laptop and tablet, offering the best of both worlds when you need it. At first glance, this is a neat laptop, which, however, allows you to rotate the panel 360 degrees to use it as a touch-screen tablet.

The HP Spectre x360 (2021) is a major upgrade over its predecessor in terms of components and performance, and is a showcase for the potential of Intel's 11th generation mobile chips. All in all, with a new processor and a hefty 16GB of RAM, the laptop runs fast and responsive with Windows 11. We multitasked it, opening multiple apps and multiple tabs in the Microsoft Edge browser, with little to no change in performance.

One of the biggest improvements Intel is pushing with the new Intel Evo platform is battery life, and the HP Specter x360 won't disappoint. It lasted 11 hours and 22 minutes in our battery life test, which ran a looped 1080p video file at 50% panel brightness until the battery ran out.

Before you is an outstanding and very portable laptop, although expensive, but very capable in the field of drawing and digital art.

## Dell XPS 17 (2021)

The main highlight of the XPS series of Dell laptops has always been optional 4K panels. This time, the XPS 17 touchscreen model came to us with an OLED panel. And while we continue to consider the Dell XPS 13 the best in the series, that doesn't change the fact that the 17th showed off one of the best screens on the market.

With powerful 11th Gen Intel Core processors and Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 graphics, it's no surprise that the XPS 17 (2021) handles everyday workloads with ease.

However, the laptop's potential is unleashed in the creative pursuits that let the stunning 4K OLED display shine. Whether you're running Adobe Photoshop, Premier, or Blender on your laptop, XPS will save you tons of time with the speed of the RTX 3060's CUDA cores.

Pair a powerful discrete graphics card with plenty of RAM and the power of H-Series processors, and you'll find a laptop capable of 4K video editing from your lap while you're on the go, without compromising performance.

Of course, the Dell XPS 17 (2021) isn't the perfect drawing laptop like its competitor above, it requires a substantial investment, but you get exactly what you pay for.

## Acer Spin 5 (2020)

Typically, 2-in-1 hybrid laptops rely on classic 16:9 widescreens, which are almost twice as wide as they are tall, which can cause bouts of claustrophobia for users who try to write or poke at such panels. However, Spin 5 is a game-changer offering a fantastic 3:2.

The bundled stylus is small and might seem flimsy to some, but you'll have to reckon with a dedicated charging port and storage space inside the laptop that eliminates the possibility of losing the stylus, increasing portability and functionality.

Digital artists are well aware of the problem of a suddenly dead pen, here again Spin stood out by offering very fast charging from a laptop, 15-20 seconds of charging is enough to use the stylus for about an hour and a half.

The Acer Spin 5 looks cheap, which can play tricks on you as it's a lot more powerful than it looks. In its cramped chassis, Intel Ice Lake processors with new Iris Plus integrated graphics have found their place, which even copes well with some games.

In the field of multitasking, the latest Spin 5 is a champion. Its processor effortlessly juggles creative applications, except for the most demanding ones. The presence of 16 GB of RAM on board will ensure you run resource-intensive applications, including the ubiquitous Photoshop.

## iPad Pro 12.9 (2021)

The latest iPad Pro 12.9 M1 (2021) tablet isn't for everyone. The main limitation that repels most interested users is its pricing, the second reason is the size, because not everyone needs such a large screen on a tablet, which, by the way, should be mobile. Unless the artists will be satisfied.

The new LED Liquid Retina XDR Mini is crazy: very high brightness is simply not available in other tablets. It can even compete with the new Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra, which received one of the best screens on the market recently. This panel is great for drawing, watching movies or everyday tasks.

The Apple M1 has long been familiar to everyone, but we will not get tired of discussing its outstanding features again and again, because this is a computer-class chipset that is installed in a tablet. Do you need that kind of power? Probably not, however, if you're looking for a tablet that outperforms every other tablet on the market, the latest Pro is a good choice.

To justify the high price of this tablet, you will have to unleash the potential of its processor, and this is only possible with demanding games, energy-intensive art applications, or multitasking that knows no limits. The new chipset loads applications much faster than before, it is vital for the load, because it simply will not notice everyday tasks.

The battery life is quite acceptable for an artist, as promised by the manufacturer, it works for less than 10 hours on a single charge. The experience will of course vary depending on the tasks performed by the tablet, but the tablet's stamina is enough not to disappoint the end user.

## Microsoft Surface Pro 8

When you're building a device as portable as the Surface Pro 8, the main challenge is balancing compactness with performance. You want a fast and light machine, but at the same time you need to maintain battery capacity and solve cooling problems so that you can work not only from the table.

According to processor benchmarks, the new Surface Pro 8 is almost 50% faster than the Surface Pro 7, frankly, an incredible gain between generations. The difference doesn't stand out as much in GeekBench 4, but the new tablet is still substantially faster.

The Surface Pro 8 is much more impressive than the Surface Laptop Studio. The tablet is only 12% behind the Microsoft creative workstation in Cinebench, and in GeekBench the difference is even less, only 5%. Remember, the Surface Pro 8 is twice as thin as the Laptop Studio and nearly half as light, which means it's an incredibly powerful drawing and design tablet.

When testing Surface Pro 8 battery life with PCMark 10, we managed to squeeze out at least 8 hours of battery life, which will allow you to be creative all day long without recharging. The new Surface Pro 8 is great for artists, illustrators and other graphics professionals, especially when you add the Surface Pen. This is an indispensable tablet for every artist who has to work on the go.


### How to choose the best laptop and tablet for drawing?
The best laptops and tablets for drawing and other creative activities promise their users a comfortable creative experience on the go. Your choice will be dictated by your content creation requirements.

If you plan to use heavy graphics programs for creative work, choose a laptop with a powerful processor and plenty of RAM. Users who are constantly on the go should pay attention to the battery life and high brightness of the panel.

Moreover, when working with a set of peripherals, make sure that the laptop has the right ports to connect them.

### How we test laptops and drawing tablets
To select the best laptops and tablets for drawing, we evaluated performance, portability and storage space, as well as screen size and quality.

We paid attention to the processor and RAM, as well as the capabilities of devices in a variety of graphics applications, including Adobe and Illustrator. We also rated battery life, as drawing laptops are about getting creative on the go.

Not without testing games, of course, we also paid attention to sound quality. And, finally, an important factor was the complete peripherals, like a stylus and others.
